# Google 2.0

This application is a replica of [Google](https://www.google.com/) which is owned by [Alphabet Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.). This clone is built using Javascript frameworks like React, and Next and a CSS utility framework called TailwindCSS. The [Google Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction) allows users to create a search engine tailored to their needs, therefore mimicking Google's search engine. The API is offered by Google for free, and one can obtain an API key by signing into their Google account. A feature called Pagination refers to the process of dividing digital content into separate, discrete pages and often represented with "Next" and "Previous" links in a numbered format. This feature renders two pages in a clone based on a user's request.

## Features

- **Responsive Web**: Responsive Web Design using React, Next & TailwindCSS.
- **Search Results Display**: Displays relevant results based on the user's search query.
- **Pagination**: It is employed to prevent the loading of an overwhelming amount of data all at once. Instead of displaying potentially thousands of results on a single page, results are broken down into manageable page-sized chunks.
